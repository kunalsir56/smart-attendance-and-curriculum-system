## Project Preview
Student verifies identity → attendance recorded → data synced to dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Python / JavaScript
- Face Recognition (face-api.js)
- QR Code Scanning
- REST APIs
- MySQL Database
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Folder Structure
- `backend/` – Server-side logic and APIs
- `frontend/` – UI for students and teachers
- `screenshots/` – Project output images

## How It Works
